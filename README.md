# -Installation-Request-Workflow-n8n-

## Overview
This n8n workflow automates handling installation requests submitted through a form.  
It checks whether the preferred installation date is within the next **7 days** and automatically sends a Slack notification to the sales team if the request is urgent.  
Requests outside this timeframe do not trigger any action.
